	<p id = p1>I need cheese! I need cheese! <br> 
		Didn't you know? It sends power to my knees! <br>
		So give it to me, please, pretty please, <br>
		my mood in all ways it does appease. <br>
		 <br>
		I'll have it on crackers, I'll have it on rye, <br>
		without the stuff I'll surely die. <br>
		I don't know how, I don't know why, <br>
		but take it away, and I'll sit down and cry!<br>
		 <br>
		I've got to have cheese, it's my heart's desire, <br>
		I've got to have cheese, for my body's on fire. <br>
		Without my cheese the results may be dire, <br>
		for without it I fear I may expire! <br>
